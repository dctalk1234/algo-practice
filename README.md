# algo-practice

This is a repo to keep track of algos as they are completed by my students and by myself.



## Directions
- Fork and clone this repo.
- Create a new folder with the name of your algorithm.
- Inside that folder add two files, one that is a markdown file with the prompt for the algorithm and one file that is the solution in your specific language.
- Submit a pull request to this repo
- Find a new algo and start the process over!
