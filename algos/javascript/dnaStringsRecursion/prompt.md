# dnaStrings 

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as are "C" and "G". Write a function called dnaTransform that takes in a DNA string and returns a string that represents it's compliment.


```
 * @param {str} // a string of DNA
 * @return {str} // a string of the DNA's counterpart

 // INPUT:
// "ATTGC"

// OUTPUT:
// => "TAACG"

let dnaStrings = (str) => {

  return dna;
}
```
