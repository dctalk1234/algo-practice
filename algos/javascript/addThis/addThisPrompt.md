# addThis

When a neutral or positive only number/integer is repeated, add all its digits until the result only has 1 digit left.

Very cool algorithm that breaks apart large integers into single digits and re-adding them back up to return a single digit only.

This will only work for integers. No strings etc; error will be the given string is undefined. 

Example:
```
when digits = 62, the function will process it like 6 + 2 = 8. Finished.
```

Example #2: 
```
when digits = 69, the function will process it like: 6 + 9 = 15, 1 + 5 = 6. Finished.
```
